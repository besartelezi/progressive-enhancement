        <h3>The story</h3>

<blockquote><p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="all-neighbors">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>
    <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="all-neighbors">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> </p>
    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="all-neighbors">Oh dear, that’s too <dfn class="bad">bad</dfn>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q></p>
    <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="all-neighbors">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>
    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <dfn class="good">good</dfn> or <dfn class="bad">bad</dfn> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <dfn class="good">good</dfn> fortune.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><dfn class="good">Good</dfn> and <dfn class="bad">Bad</dfn> are just one perspective. Bananas are <dfn class="good">good</dfn> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <dfn class="good">good</dfn> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
